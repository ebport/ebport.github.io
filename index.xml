      <description>I will be starting the Georgia Tech OMSCS program this fall. It has been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve been in school, so I put together a simple refresher course based on the feedback from reddit, google+, and omscentral.
Hopefully my thought process can be helpful to others. Obviously preparation will vary depending on individual goals and background. I&amp;rsquo;ll update early in the first semester with feedback and what I wish I would have known.</description>

      <title>Build a Fitbit Heart Rate Extract</title>

      <description>A Fitbit collects an incredible amount of granular data on personal activity, heart rate, and sleep. However, currently most of the detailed data is locked up within the app. This tutorial shows a simple way to extract the heart rate data in an automated fashion.
This code will generate &amp;lsquo;personal data extracts&amp;rsquo; according to simple specifications, without requiring any copy pasting or manual effort beyond the initial configuration.
Many others have posted helpful tutorials on this topic.</description>
