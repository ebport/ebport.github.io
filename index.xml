      <description>A Basic Teradata SQL-Mode for Emacs Lately I have been learning emacs and building out a development workflow.
I wanted a seamless experience querying Teradata during develpement. I&amp;rsquo;m typically working on shell scripts that use sql through either bteq or tpt.
Code Here is what I wrote up extending the sql-mode package. This is loaded in my init.el file with (load &amp;quot;my-path/teradata.el&amp;quot;). This requires bteq to be installed and in the path.</description>

      <description>Recently I have been writing a lot of code to generate flat file extracts from REST apis. This task is relatively straightforward, but can be quite time consuming if not approached in the correct manner.
In this post I have put together a simple example pipeline for quickly generating an extract using Python with the requests library. The goal is to be able to have a flat file extract ready to analyze in an hour or less.</description>

      <description>I will be starting the Georgia Tech OMSCS program this fall. It has been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve been in school, so I put together a simple refresher course based on the feedback from reddit, google+, and omscentral.
Hopefully my thought process can be helpful to others. Obviously preparation will vary depending on individual goals and background. I&amp;rsquo;ll update early in the first semester with feedback and what I wish I would have known.</description>

      <description>A Fitbit collects an incredible amount of granular data on personal activity, heart rate, and sleep. However, currently most of the detailed data is locked up within the app. This tutorial shows a simple way to extract the heart rate data in an automated fashion.
This code will generate &amp;lsquo;personal data extracts&amp;rsquo; according to simple specifications, without requiring any copy pasting or manual effort beyond the initial configuration.
Many others have posted helpful tutorials on this topic.</description>
